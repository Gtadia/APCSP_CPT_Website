                        The Create Performance Task, or the CPT for short, is the part of the Advanced Placement
                        Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) exam where students can create a program of their own choosing
                        in any language of their choosing as long as those languages will help you achieve those
                        requirements. However, what are those requirements and how do you make sure that the program
                        that you wrote meets said requirements? That's what we're going to be talking about in the
                        next page.

                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich for Netscape Navigator 2.0. It was intended to be a lightweight language to make web pages more dynamic. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

                        JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 19971. It is now widely adopted by all major browsers and web platforms. It can also be used for mobile apps, desktop applications, server-side programming, games, etc4.

                        JavaScript is important because it enables interactive web development, supports multiple paradigms and frameworks, and has a large community of developers.

                            The requirements for the CPT can sometimes be confusing, especially to those who are either new to
                            programming. So, the list below summarizes all the requirements in a easy to understand list with
                            plenty of examples in the next couple of pages.

                        <li>The program must have some functionality</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In other words, the program must do something with the input</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The program must have an output</li>

                        <li>One (or more) use of an array (AKA list or other data collection methods)</li>
                        <li>One (or more) use of the array(s) serving a purpose in the program's functionality</li>

                        <li>Explain why the list manages complexity in the program</li>

                        <li>A function/method with a least 1 parameter.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must call the function.</li>

                                <li>EX: Sequencing is when code is executed from line 1 to line 2 and line 3 and so on</li>

                            <li>The program must have a purpose (So you must create a program that asks users relevant information, have functions that do things with that input (perferably without any extra bluff), and output relevatnt infomration)</li>
