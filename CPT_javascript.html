                        The Create Performance Task, or the CPT for short, is the part of the Advanced Placement
                        Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) exam where students can create a program of their own choosing
                        in any language of their choosing as long as those languages will help you achieve those
                        requirements. However, what are those requirements and how do you make sure that the program
                        that you wrote meets said requirements? That's what we're going to be talking about in the
                        next page.

                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich for Netscape Navigator 2.0. It was intended to be a lightweight language to make web pages more dynamic. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

                        JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 19971. It is now widely adopted by all major browsers and web platforms. It can also be used for mobile apps, desktop applications, server-side programming, games, etc4.

                        JavaScript is important because it enables interactive web development, supports multiple paradigms and frameworks, and has a large community of developers.
